# Customer-churning-prediction

## Specifying the question

Creating different models that can predict whether a customer churns or not given the customer's information.

## Context
Churning is a measure of the number of individuals moving out over a specific period. Credit card churning is the frequent opening of credit cards to get signed up on bonuses and then cancel them. Banks, in particular, require to constantly improve their services especially the credit card service in order to keep customers. They constantly “dish out” digital services and not really focus on how the customers feel about that particular service. They have not been able to maintain their premium customers, denting their revenue. On the other hand, they have tried sending out surveys to them to try and understand why they’re dissatisfied. Unfortunately, the surveys get a very poor response of about 5-30%.
